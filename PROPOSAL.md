# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Golam Mahi
       
# Intentions:

A virus that opens a tab. It forks and duplicates whenever the tab is closed. It has allocated memory at two locations; if one location is detected to be closed, the other one reopens it.
    
# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface).
  
# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

Forking by reading the kill signal. Executing the command to open up a specific tab. Semaphores to communicate between the allocated memory.
  
What data structures you will be using and how.
     
What algorithms and /or data structures you will be using, and how.
    
# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project.
